# Project 2: DESEO

### Overview

For my second project I have created a Wishlist app to store recommendations for Films, TV Series, Books, Restaurants and Podcasts. I decided to make this app because I always find that I am writing all my recommendations on so many different notes on my phone and rarely get around to looking at them. So having one place to store all of these would be extremely useful. The link to Heroku and my GitHub is below:

### Trello

I used Trello throughout my project in order to keep track of what I needed to do and what I had already completed. This allowed me to prioritise and to make sure I got the project done in time. The screenshots below were taken during the project:

### Challenges and Problems

- The main challenge at the beginning was planning out the whole project. Because I wanted to use a lot of different resources as well as creating a users Wishlist's page it took me quite a while to get my head round it. Once I had figured out how it would all be laid out it was pretty straight forward getting the main functionality working.

-  API'S: I found implementing the API's for Films and TV Series challenging as I had never done this properly before. I had to get quite a lot help for the first one but when implementing the second one it was a lot easier. When implementing them in future I think I will be a lot more capable.
  - The main challenge with this was being able to select a specific film or tv series out of the API and then to attach it to the user in order to then take that data and push it onto their Wishlist page.

---

###Â Wins

- I am happy with how the project has turned out and really happy that I managed to include two API's for the films and TV series.

- I found the main functionality of the views to be relatively straightforward and managed to get it done pretty quickly.

### Future Features

Features I would have liked to include:

- I originally planned on using an API for books, restaurants and podcasts as well so that users could search from their databases for the ones they would like to add to their Wishlist. However, I ran out of time so I would to add these.

- A page so that the user can add the completed items on the Wishlist to a 'Done' page so that they have a record of them. They can then rate and comment on these for future reference.

- The ability to view other users Wishlist's and thus be able to follow other people's. Then I would like to make it possible for users to comment and rate each other's items on their Wishlist's.

- A page so that users can view the trending films and TV series, the best selling books and the most popular restaurants and podcasts.

- A slick carousel for the TV series as well as the films.
